Scenario from project description:
> You have been hired as a full stack developer at _Periodic Tables_, a startup that is creating a reservation system for fine dining restaurants.
> The software is used only by restaurant personnel when a customer calls to request a reservation.
> At this point, the customers will not access the system online.

## Summary
This is a full-stack app that is used by employees at a restaurant so that they can manage reservations.
